efficiencyvspIn- This is the graph for the question one. When you call the function you must put in the range for the Power you would like to see. To reproduce the graph you would call the function efficiencyvspIn with the paramerters ([0 100]). So it would look like this, efficiencyvspIn([0 100])
enduranceVsfuelCapacity - This is the graph for the question two. To reproduce the graph you would call the function enduranceVsfuelCapacity with the paramerters ([25 100]). So it would look like this, enduranceVsfuelCapacity([25 100])
When you call the function you must put in the range for the graph you would like to see or it will give you an error.
A PDF is attached with answers to questions 3,4,5,6.
